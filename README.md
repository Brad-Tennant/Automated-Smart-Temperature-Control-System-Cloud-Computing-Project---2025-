# Automated-Smart-Temperature-Control-System-Cloud-Computing-Project---2025-
A simple automated fan system that reads temperature and humidity (DHT11) and turns a DC motor fan on/off based on a set temperature. The fan can be controlled three ways: Auto mode, Manual mode through LabVIEW, and remote control through a Ubidots dashboard. All readings and fan states are sent to the cloud for real time monitoring.

Features:

Automatic fan control using temperature thresholds

LabVIEW HMI for local control

Ubidots dashboard for remote control + data logging

Physical pushbutton manual toggle

Arduino Mega + L293D motor driver
